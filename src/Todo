When adding a role to a user, the role object is not updated

We currently store roles in an array, we need to store it in an object like so
[
    {
        'view_post': 'inherit'
    },
    {
        'edit_post': 'true'
    }
]

Id like to keep most things type safe, so yes, true is a string in this case, as we need 3 different values
'inherit' -> it means that this permission will be inherited from the users role

'true' -> even if the user dosent have the permission, they can view the post.

'false' -> even if the user has the permission, they can not view the post. 

everything has a 'returnError' Paramater, need to refactor to remove this
